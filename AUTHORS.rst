Textext was initially based on InkLaTeX written by Toru Araki.

It has been rewritten by Pauli Virtanen <pav@iki.fi> in 2006 and
maintained until 2009.

It has been heavily extended by Pit Garbe <piiit@gmx.de> in 2014.

Since 2014 it is maintained and developed by
Sergei Izmailov <sergei.a.izmailov@gmail.com> and
Jan Winkler <enceladus@posteo.de>.
