Key features
------------

-  Multi-line editor, optionally with syntax highlighting
-  Compatibility with TexText down to version 0.4.x
-  Compilation of TeX code using PdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX or LuaLaTex
-  Free scaling of the produced output either by dragging with the mouse
   in Inkscape or by setting a scale factor manually in the TexText GUI.
   Both approaches are compatible to each other. Scaling is kept after
   re-editing the code or can be adjusted later.
-  Possibility of exact font size matching with Inkscape text
-  TeX preamble file can be freely configured (additional packages,
   parskip, parindent, etc.)
-  Colorization of the produced output via TeX commands or directly by
   Inkscape. Colorization is kept after re-editing the TeX code.
-  It is possible to specify the alignment anchor of the produced
   output. By this it is possible to fix e.g. the top left corner of the
   produced svg output from compilation to compilation.
-  TeXText uses either pdf2svg or pstoedit+ghostscript as converter for
   producing svg code from the generated pdf.
