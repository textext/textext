Version 1.11.1 (2025-03-13)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- New: The error dialog additionally presents a traceback of the error
       (thanks to user202729)
- Fixed: Setup crashes when symbolic links are used in the user's extension
         folder (thanks to user202729).
- Fixed: Setup crashes when Inkscape extension command subsystem fails

Version 1.11.0 (2025-01-06)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Fixed (the most annoying issue!):
  Horizontal lines as they appear in \frac or \sqrt commands cannot be
  colorized by setting the fill color. If they have been manually colored
  by setting the stroke color the lines disappear after re-compilation.
- New: removed the Stroke to Path option, it is not necessary anymore due to
       the fix mentioned above.
- New: typst preamble and preview support
- New: It is possible to change the command line options for the LaTeX compilers (useful e.g. to incorporate
       the -shell-escape option). See
       `this FAQ entry <https://textext.github.io/textext/usage/faq.html#compiling-latex-code-with-additional-command-line-options-e-g-shell-escape>`__
       in the documentation
- Fixed: typst snippets contain a large empty background frame
- Fixed: TexText fails silently if unhandled errors occur.

Version 1.10.2 (2024-02-20)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Fixed: Wrong environment inserted when `Display Math` option is selected 
  in `New Node Content` menu while typst is the active compiler (:Issue:`417`)

Version 1.10.1 (2023-11-18)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Fixed: Installation issue on Windows.

Version 1.10.0 (2023-11-17)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- New: Basic support for `typst <https://typst.app/>`__. Typst is a markup-based
  typesetting system.

Version 1.9.0 (2023-07-26)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Compatibility with Inkscape 1.3. This version does not support Inkscape
  versions 1.2 and older anymore!

Version 1.8.2 (2022-08-27)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Fixed: Each time the extension is executed an annoying warning
  ``<frozen importlib._bootstrap>:671: ImportWarning: DynamicImporter.exec_module() not found; falling back to load_module()``
  is shown (actually, this is the problem of the underlying GTK-framework, not
  of TexText) (:issue:`350`)

Version 1.8.1 (2022-02-23)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Fixed: When re-installing TexText with diffent paths to latex excutables
  compared to the original setup these new paths are not recognized when
  invoking TexText from Inkscape (:issue:`345`).

Version 1.8.0 (2022-02-03)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- New: It is now possible to use the ``\documentclass`` statement in the
  preamble file. This makes it easier to adjust the fontsize. Old preamble
  files without the ``\documentclass`` statement can still be used.
- Changed: Instructions for installation of TexText for Inkscape in
  Windows PortableApps (fixes :issue:`288`)

Version 1.7.1 (2022-01-04)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Fixed: In Inkscape 1.2-dev new nodes are not placed in the center of the view.
  (:issue:`338`)

Version 1.7.0 (2021-12-27)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- New: Adjustable font size in LaTeX code editor (GTK GUI only)
- Fixed: distutils deprecation warning when running under Python 3.10
- Open: In Inkscape 1.2-dev new nodes are not placed in the center of the view.
  (:issue:`338`)

Version 1.6.1 (2021-11-16)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Fixed: When LaTeX-code is imported via the `File` - `Open` dialog
  the error message `ResourceWarning: unclosed file <_io.TextIOWrapper name'...'`
  is shown. (:issue:`322`)

Version 1.6.0 (2021-10-07)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Fixed: Generated svg objects appear sometimes flipped or far away from
  the view center (:issue:`283`, :issue:`313`)

- New: It is now possible to install TexText system wide for all users
  (setup script only, see
  `setup documentation <https://textext.github.io/textext/install/advanced.html>`_,
  :issue:`247`, :issue:`314`)

Version 1.5.0 (2021-08-19)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Changed: The feature enabling easy colorization of TexText svg nodes
  containing `\sqrt`, `\frac`, and other commands introducing strokes
  (lines) in Inkscape is now optional, see
  `documentation <https://textext.github.io/textext/usage/gui.html#colorization-of-the-output>`_.
  Reason for this is the increased compilation time (cf. :issue:`304`).

- New (experimental): Support of Inkscape extension manager
  (manual install of file downloaded from
  `Inkscape extension site <https://inkscape.org/~jcwinkler/%E2%98%85textext>`_)

- New (Inkscape on MS Windows): User defined locations of Inkscape
  installed via the msi-Installer are correctly identified by the
  setup-script.

Version 1.4.0 (2021-05-31)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- New: TexText svg nodes can be colorized now by a single click even
  if they contain strokes (as, for example, in fractions,
  square-roots or overlines). Just select the node in Inkscape and
  click on the fill color in the color bar as you do it with normal
  Inkscape text (:issue:`291`).

  *Note*: Due to this, execution time per node compilation is longer
  compared to previous versions of TexText. However, you do not need to
  colorize strokes manually in Inkscape anymore. On Windows, also
  a slight flickering on the screen might appear while the TeX code
  is compiled.
- Documentation improvements

Version 1.3.1 (2021-02-26)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Fixed: Setup script fails on Windows if Inkscape has been installed
  via the .msi installer (:issue:`280`)

  executable in Windows setup script (:issue:`280`)
- Added: Detailed explanation of setup script options (Linux, MacOS,
  Windows)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Fixed: Double backslashes and missing line breaks occur when using
  TexText 1.2.0 on nodes created with TexText <= 1.1 (:issue:`265`)

  **Note: A one-time manual insertion of line breaks will be necessary
  when opening such nodes. When having saved them again the line breaks
  are kept in the future. Double backslashes are replaced by single ones
  automatically.**
- Fixed: Opening TexText is slow (:issue:`263`)
- Fixed: Windows installation script complains about missing
  Python GTK3 bindings (:issue:`262`)
- New: Added explanation to the FAQ/ documentation how to
  define a shortcut for opening TexText (:issue:`259`). Refer to
  https://textext.github.io/textext/usage/faq.html#defining-keyboard-shortcut-for-opening-textext-dialog

Version 1.2.0 (2020-10-22)

  recompilation (:issue:`245`)
- Fixed: `temp.tex` file not encoded in UTF-8 (:issue:`241`)
- Fixed: Installation on Windows via batch file fails if path to
  batch file contains spaces (:issue:`232`)
- New: TexText group ID is kept after recompilation (:issue:`256`)

Version 0.7 (2017-12-15)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Fixed:
  Plugin does not run with Inkscape 0.92.2 under Windows

- New:
  Global and local scale factor. This feature enables the user to set the scale
  factor of a node to the value used while editing the previous node (Button
  "Global"). Hence, it is easier to change several nodes to the same scale
  factor. It is always possible to reset the scale factor to the value used for
  creating the node (Button "Reset").

  If working with Inkscape files stored with older versions of Inkscape or TexText
  it could happen that - after editing of a LaTeX node - the rendered object becomes
  invisible (in fact: transparent) because the fill attribute was not properly set.

- Fixed:
  Installation under MS Windows as non admin user ends up with the plugin installed
  into the wrong directory.

  setup.py for the Linux installation does not run under Python 3.

- Improved:
  More detailled error information is passed to the user during setup of the
  Linux package.

  The readme-files have been updated to the new version number. Furthermore, links
  for download of the additional software have been added as well as a comment
  that the plugin will only work usign 32bit versions of Inkscape. Furthermore,
  there is only one readme now for both, Linux and Windows.
