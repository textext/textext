.. _windows-install:

====================
|TexText| on Windows
====================

- If you use Inkscape in PortableApps please go to `these special instructions <portableapps-install_>`_.
- If you use Inkscape 1.2, 1.1, or 1.0 you have to use `TexText 1.8.2 <https://github.com/textext/textext/releases/tag/1.8.2>`_

.. _windows-install-preparation:

Preparation
===========
1. Make sure that |Inkscape| is installed on your system and you checked
   the ``Python`` option in ``Program Files`` as well as the ``Extensions`` options in
   ``Inkscape Data`` during the installation of Inkscape (by default this is the case).

    .. figure:: ../images/inkscape-install-options-windows.png
       :alt: Necessary installation options in Inkscape


2. Make sure that an operational LaTeX distribution is installed on your system. You can verify
   this by invoking at least one of :bash:`pdflatex --version`, :bash:`xelatex --version`,
   :bash:`lualatex --version`, and :bash:`typst --version` in a command or power shell window.

   .. warning::

       Make sure that automatic package installation is either set to
       ``Never install missing packages on-the-fly`` or set to
       ``Always install missing packages on-the-fly``. You can configure this
       feature during installation of MiKTeX or later in the `MiKTeX console <https://miktex.org/howto/miktex-console>`_.


3. Optional: If you wish to have syntax highlighting and some other :ref:`nice features <usage-gui-config>`
   enabled in the |TexText|-Gui install GtkSourceView. For that purpose download the GtkSourceView package
   that matches your Inkscape installation type

   - `GtkSourceview 3 for Inkscape 1.x 64-bit <gtksourceview-windows-64-bit_>`_
   - `GtkSourceview 3 for Inkscape 1.x 32-bit <gtksourceview-windows-32-bit_>`_

   and run the corresponding installer. It will add a small amount of files into your |Inkscape|
   installation. You need administrator privileges for this step. If you do not trust the installer
   you will find zip packages on the `GtkSourceView for Inkscape project site <gtksourceview-inkscape-site_>`_
   for manual installation.

.. important::

    Compared to previous versions |TexText| does not need any conversion utilities like ghostscript,
    pstoedit or pdfsvg. Furthermore, the required Python bindings for the GTK3-GUI
    are already included in the windows version of |Inkscape|.

.. _windows-install-textext:

Download and install |TexText|
==============================

You have two options: A setup script or a GUI based installer.

Setup script (recommended)
--------------------------

1. Download the most recent package from :textext_current_release_page:`release` (direct links: :textext_download_zip:`Windows`)
   (Download the `TexText 1.8.2 package <https://github.com/textext/textext/releases/tag/1.8.2>`_
   in case you are still using Inkscape 1.2, 1.1, or 1.0)
2. Extract the package and change into the created directory.
3. Double click on the file :bash:`setup_win.bat`. The script will check if all requirements
   described :ref:`above <windows-install-preparation>` are met. If so, it will install the extension
   files into the user's Inkscape configuration directory (usually this is
   ``%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Inkscape``).

See :ref:`advanced-install` for further options provided by
:bash:`setup_win.bat`.

.. note::

    In case of installation problems refer to the :ref:`trouble_installation` in the :ref:`troubleshooting` section!




Installer
---------

You can also use a GUI based installer:

1. Download the most recent installer from :textext_current_release_page:`GitHub release page <release>` (direct links: :textext_download_exe:`Windows`)
2. Use the installer and follow the instructions. It will copy the required files into the user's Inkscape
   configuration directory (usually this is ``%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Inkscape``).

.. note::

    The installer does not perform any requirement checks. This means that the extension might
    fail to run if you did not install the programs mentioned
    :ref:`above <windows-install-preparation>` correctly.


You are done. Now you can consult the :ref:`usage instructions <gui>`.

.. _windows-install-library:
.. _windows-install-gtk3:
.. _windows-install-tkinter:

Problems with the GUI framework
-------------------------------

The GUI framework should already be included in the Inkscape installation on Windows.
Hence, if the |TexText| installer complains about missing GTK3 or TkInter bindings
please file a bug report on `github <https://github.com/textext/textext/issues/new/choose>`_

.. _portableapps-install:

Installation for Inkscape in PortableApps
=========================================

If you use Inkscape in PortableApps you have to proceed as follows:

1. Download the most recent package from :textext_current_release_page:`release` (direct links: :textext_download_zip:`Windows`)
2. Extract the package and change into the created directory.
3. Open a Windows command prompt or Windows power shell window  in this directory
   (``SHIFT`` + right-click in the Windows explorer, then select `Open powershell window here`)
4. Enter and execute the following command where ``C:\Path\To\Your\PartableApps\Installation``
   is the path to your PortableApps installation (usually this is ``C:\User\YourUserName\PortableApps``):

   .. code-block:: bash

        setup_win.bat --portable-apps-dir "C:\Path\To\Your\PartableApps\Installation"

   If you also use your LaTeX system from PortableApps use the following command instead:

   .. code-block:: bash

        setup_win.bat --portable-apps-dir "C:\Path\To\Your\PartableApps\Installation" --pdflatex-executable "C:\Path\To\pdflatex.exe"

   (use ``--lualatex-executable`` and ``--xelatex-executable`` if you also want to have
   lualatex and xelatex available as well)

   See :ref:`advanced-install` for further options provided by :bash:`setup_win.bat`.
