=============================
Advanced installation options
=============================

The :bash:`setup.py` / :bash:`setup_win.bat` installation script offers several
options to adapt the installation process to your system configuration:

-h, --help
    Show help message and exit.

--inkscape-extensions-path INKSCAPE_EXTENSIONS_PATH
    Path to inkscape extensions directory. Use this if the user
    extensions are installed in an unusual place.

--inkscape-executable INKSCAPE_EXECUTABLE
    Full path to inkscape executable.  Use this if |Inkscape| is not found
    automatically by the setup script (Test- or Beta-installations).

--pdflatex-executable PDFLATEX_EXECUTABLE
    Full path to pdflatex executable.

--lualatex-executable LUALATEX_EXECUTABLE
    Full path to lualatex executable.

--xelatex-executable XELATEX_EXECUTABLE
    Full path to xelatex executable.

--typst-executable TYPST_EXECUTABLE
    Full path to typst executable.

--use-tk
    Use the Tk Interface (tkinter) for the user interface instead of the GTK3 UI.
    This might be useful in cases where the GTK3 installation is broken, i.e.
    when loading of the framework works but execution errors occur. In that case
    TexText will not fall back to tkinter automatically. Hence, this switch can
    be used to bypass the GTK3 framework.

--portable-apps-dir INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY_OF_PORTABLEAPPS
    Windows only: If you use Inkscape from PortableApps use this parameter
    to specifiy the directory into which PortableApps has been installed, e.g.
    ``C:\Users\YourUserName\PortableApps``. It ensures that |TexText| is
    installed correctly into the PortableApps structure.

    .. attention::
        If you also have your LaTeX distribution installed in PortableApps
        you need to specify the paths to the latex executables by
        using the ``--pdflatex-executable`` and/or ``--lualatex-executable``
        and/or ``--xelatex-executable`` arguments.

--skip-requirements-check
    Bypass minimal requirements check. |TexText| will be installed even if
    the requirements for running it are not met.

--skip-extension-install
    Don't install extension (just check the requirements).

--keep-previous-installation-files
    Keep files from previous installation which might have been modified
    by the user (e.g. preamble files) without prompting the user

--all-users
    Install globally for all users (sudo/ admin privileges required)

    .. caution::
        Usually, this works well. However, you should keep in mind that the
        |TexText| files are copied into Inkscape's global extension folder,
        hence cluttering your Inkscape installation. You may need to remove these
        files manually when you uninstall Inkscape.

--color always, --color never
    Enables/disable console colors.

--verbose
    Print additional messages during setup
