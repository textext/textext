Version 0.7 (2017-12-15)
========================
Fixed:
Plugin does not run with Inkscape 0.92.2 under Windows

New:
Global and local scale factor. This feature enables the user to set the scale
factor of a node to the value used while editing the previous node (Button
"Global"). Hence, it is easier to change several nodes to the same scale
factor. It is always possible to reset the scale factor to the value used for
creating the node (Button "Reset").

New:
Added compatibility to ImageMagick 7 (version 6 is still supported) (issue #32, #39)

Workaround:
A message is displayed if pstoedit failed to produce svg output and ghostscript
< 9.21 is installed on the system (issues #44, #48, #50).


Version 0.6.1 (2017-02-13)
==========================
Fixed:
"global name 'WindowsError' is not defined" - on Linux when using Preview

Fixed:
Typos "lates_messaga" in textext.py

Improved:

Improved:
License packaged


Version 0.6 (2017-02-01)
========================
Fixed:
"too many values to unpack"-error in Inkscape 0.92

Fixed:
TexText does not work with 64-bit versions of Inkscape under MS Windows

Improved:
TexText does not care anymore if 32-bit or 64-bit versions of pstoedit,
ImageMagick and ghostscript are installed

Improved:
Installation of PyGTK simplified


Version 0.5.2 (2017-01-06)
==========================
Fixed:
If working with Inkscape files stored with older versions of Inkscape or TexText
it could happen that - after editing of a LaTeX node - the rendered object becomes
invisible (in fact: transparent) because the fill attribute was not properly set.

Fixed:
Installation under MS Windows as non admin user ends up with the plugin installed
into the wrong directory.

Fixed:
Column numbers do not change during editing of the LaTeX-code under Linux and TK.
The Column-number is nor removed from the dialog if the TK interface is used.

Fixed:
setup.py for the Linux installation does not run under Python 3.

Improved:
More detailled error information is passed to the user during setup of the
Linux package.

Updated:
The readme-files have been updated to the new version number. Furthermore, links
for download of the additional software have been added as well as a comment
that the plugin will only work usign 32bit versions of Inkscape. Furthermore,
there is only one readme now for both, Linux and Windows.



Version 0.5.1 (2016-10-10)
==========================
Fixed:
TexText does not work with Inkscape 0.9.1

It is ensured now that Inkscape works under both, Inkscape 0.48 and Inkscape 0.91.
